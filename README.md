# ` UFOs Challenge`


## `Project Overview ` <br/>
I was tasked to help Dana to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I was asked to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. <br/>
 #### Resources <br/>
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google). <br/>
•	Software: VSC, Java Script, HTML, Git Bash. <br/>
## `Results `<br/>

On the left side of the webpage, there are specific input text boxes called "Filter Search" with a placeholder set. Fill out your designated date, city, state, country, and shape in lower cases. You can fill all  input text boxes or just some of them.

After that press the Tab or Enter button to see suggested results.

## ` Summary`


Filter criteria are case sensitive and the dataset is entirely lower case. It is logical that  country and state abbreviations are capitalized and this generates some issues. <br/>
I would recommend to make the criteria filtering more forgivable by eliminating case sensitivity and add a button to clear all criteria from the entry fields.
